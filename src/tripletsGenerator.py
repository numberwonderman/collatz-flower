# Here is a simple Python code snippet to start generating the Collatz triples using the emission formula $$ F_k(m) = \frac{4km + 1}{3} $$ for $$ k=1,2,3 $$ where $$m$$ is an odd integer:

def collatz_triples(m):
    """
    Given an odd integer m, return the triple generated by the emission functions:
    F_k(m) = (4 * k * m + 1) / 3, for k = 1, 2, 3.
    The function filters triples that yield integers and are odd.
    """
    triples = []
    for k in [1, 2, 3]:
        val = (4 * k * m + 1) / 3
        if val.is_integer() and int(val) % 2 == 1:
            triples.append(int(val))
    return triples

# Examples and test
for odd_m in [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]:
    print(f"Triples for {odd_m}: {collatz_triples(odd_m)}")
```

This will produce triples for several sample odd integers.

### Next steps
- You can test this function for a range of odd integers.
- Write tests to check correctness according to known properties (e.g., one should be divisible by 3 and others odd).
- Use these triples to build your triangular grid structure.

If you want this as SageMath code or want help with test cases or visualization scaffolding around this, just let me know!
